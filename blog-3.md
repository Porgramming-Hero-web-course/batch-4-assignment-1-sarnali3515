# Why Are Type Guards Necessary? Exploring Different Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

Type guards in TypeScript help developers make sure their code is reliable and safe by checking the type of a variable while the code is running. TypeScript checks types before code runs, but sometimes, especially with flexible data or mixed types, it’s helpful to verify the type at runtime too. This is where type guards come in. They prevent errors and make code easier to understand.


## Common Type Guards in TypeScript

### 1. `typeof` Type Guard
This is useful for checking basic types like string, number, or boolean. For instance, using typeof ensures a variable is a specific primitive type before using it.

#### Example:
```typescript
function processValue(value: string | number) {
  if (typeof value === "string") console.log("String:", value.toUpperCase());
  else console.log("Number:", value);
}
```

### 2. `instanceof` Type Guard

For checking if an object is an instance of a particular class, instanceof is ideal, allowing safe access to class-specific properties and methods.

#### Example:
```typescript
class Dog { bark() { console.log("Woof!"); } }
const pet: any = new Dog();
if (pet instanceof Dog) pet.bark(); // Safe to call bark()
```

### 3. Custom Type Guards

Custom type guards involve writing a function that verifies if an object matches a specific interface, especially useful for complex types.

#### Example:
```typescript
interface Fish { swim(): void; }
function isFish(animal: any): animal is Fish {
  return typeof animal.swim === "function";
}
```

## Why Use Type Guards?
Without type guards, you’d have to rely on any or unknown types, which lack the specificity TypeScript provides. This increases the risk of runtime errors and makes the code harder to debug and maintain. Type guards reduce these risks by making sure you’re only accessing properties or calling methods that are valid for the actual type of the variable at runtime.

By using type guards like typeof, instanceof, and custom functions, developers can ensure their applications are safer and easier to work with. Type guards not only improve readability but also give confidence that the application will handle various types correctly, making TypeScript a powerful tool for building robust applications.
